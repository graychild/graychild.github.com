    Summer slept through the quite thunder of this year's firework shows.  We
    chose not to wake her when she was so happily sleeping.  Daddy already has
    grand plans for sparklers, snakes, fountains, and more, but those plans can
    wait.

    Though she's not really ready for fireworks, Summer is all about
    interactivity these days.  She loves to hand things back and forth, she's 
    begun to mimic in earnest, and she's starting to respond to simple games
    like, "Where's Mommy's nose?"  It's a time of wonder for the whole family.

    Mom and Dad love and miss the fireworks, but each day of play with the baby
    is even more entertaining!
