    We've tried these wrist rattles for a while, but they're not really Summer's
    thing yet.  She used to hold her arms still after we put them on.  Now she
    gives us and them an odd look or two and then happily ignores them.  I guess
    that's some form of progress, but she doesn't really shake them for the
    sound yet.
