    Summer's dad is certain sure her eyes are Gray.  The entire world disagrees
    with him.  This is so well known that comments like "She has beautiful blue
    eyes" at Thanksgiving earned an "Uh oh!" from cousin Sydney.

    Her dad is less sure of the hair color at this point, since it seems to
    contain some brown, blonde, and at times even red highlights.  At this point
    his money is on Summer being a brunette though.
