    Summer's second major holiday was spent meeting the extended Gray family.  
    Though Mimi and Papa were missed, Summer really enjoyed getting the chance
    to hang out with all of her cousins. In fact, this was the first day Mom and
    Dad heard her make a sound they would truly call a laugh.
