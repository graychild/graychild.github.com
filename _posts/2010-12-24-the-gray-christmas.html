    Summer experienced her first Gray Christmas party this year.  Still too
    innocent to play in the cutthroat Dirty Santa game, she definitely enjoyed
    spending time with her family.

    The hard part was getting some sleep.  We Grays are a loud bunch who make
    that challenging.  We eventually wore her out though.
