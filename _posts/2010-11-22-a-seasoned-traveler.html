    Summer didn't use to be much of a car seat fan, but her attitude to travel
    seems to be improving.  That just proves there's nothing a little torture
    can't fix.  Lock a baby in a box for four days of travel so Dad can give a
    45 minute speech and they'll be forced to discover the bright side.  Who
    says you can't teach babies?
