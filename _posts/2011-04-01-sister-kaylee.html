    We missed having a cat, so we went in search of a new one.  We were just
    sure we wanted a male kitten, so we went right out and adopted a seven year
    old female cat.
</p>

<p>
    We call her Kaylee.
</p>

<p>
    Kaylee was put up for adoption when her previous owner got pregnant.  It's a
    shame people still have that superstition (Yeah, it's bunk folks!), because
    Kaylee is probably the most baby friendly animal I've ever met.  Summer and
    her already get along great.
</p>

<p>
    Though she's just a Moggie (Domestic Short Hair), we think Kaylee's a
    looker.  She has medium smoky gray fur with white paws and a white bib.  Her
    eyes are a bright emerald green.  Her tail is also kinked midway down,
    giving it a neat curly-Q appearance.
</p>

<p>
    Speaking of adding another girl, has everyone noticed that Daddy is the last
    man standing in his house?  You would look into it if I mysteriously
    disappear, wouldn't you Gentle Blog Readers?!  At least Kaylee loves me.
    She's already getting good at climbing into my lap.
</p>

<p>
    Welcome to the family Kaylee!
