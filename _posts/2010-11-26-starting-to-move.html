    More and more often, we are finding Summer turned around like this when we
    fetch her out of the PlayPlace or her crib.  She does quite a bit of
    scooting around now.

    She's also been working hard at rolling over and we've seen her get pretty
    close a few times.  In fact, Dad thinks he may have accidentally stopped her
    from doing it on Thanksgiving day.  He and Summer were tossing her round
    kitty toy back and forth and she may have just followed it all the way over
    if he hadn't been so quick to return it.  Oops.
