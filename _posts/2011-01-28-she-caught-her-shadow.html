    Summer is becoming a lot more aware of the things around her.  You can often
    catch her studying various items, from her fingers to random objects in the
    house.

    Here she has caught a glimpse of her shadow.  She was immediately hooked.
    She's kicking her feet and watching the shadow move on the wall.
