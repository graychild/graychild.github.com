    There are two key lessons in this picture:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Mommy loves a challenge.  She keeps grabbing bigger and harder LEGO
        models.  This Taj Mahal is almost 6,000 pieces and by far the most 
        complex model she's ever tried.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summer wants to help and that may be a new level of difficulty.
    </li>
</ul>
