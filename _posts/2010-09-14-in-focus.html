    We are ever watchful for early signs of Summer's personality and, while it's
    hard to tell much at this age, we think we are noticing some patterns.  In
    particular, Summer is surprisingly focused for her age.
</p>

<p>
    When Summer decides she is hungry, she snaps into food seeking mode.  This
    is a dangerous time to be a parent because if her fingers don't produce milk
    (not a great track record so far) she's just as liable to try eating a
    nearby nose, chin, or anything else she can latch onto.  Maybe this one
    is mostly (primal?) instinct, but keep readingâ€¦
</p>

<p>
    Summer can now focus in on faces, parts of a mobile, or our too bright skylight
    that sears adult eyes, etc.  She will watch these items intently.  Though
    she hasn't really found her hands yet, they often reach out for these items
    of interest, a reaction of her desire to have them no doubt.  She's getting
    close and has actually made an accidental grab or two.
</p>

<p>
    When she's not active, she still seems somewhat focused.  She has a way of
    zoning out or just staring off into space.  However, I believe from watching
    her eye movements and facial expressions that it's the brain at work in
    these times.  She likes to think about things.
</p>

<p>
    All that focus is definitely paying off.  We can see her learning all the
    time.  In fact, the last day or two we think we've caught a few coos here
    and there.
