    How do we celebrate the coming new year?  By feeding the baby (semi-)solid
    food.
</p>

<p>
    Why now?  Two major reasons.  First, Summer's showing all of the signs the
    doctor told us to watch for, so we think she is ready.  Just as importantly,
    Mommy is showing all the signs of someone who needs to believe breast
    pumping will end eventually.
</p>

<p>
    I was planning to give her sushi from the moment the doctor said, "Start
    with rice," but Dana assures me that's not what she meant.  I'm sure this
    watered down single grain option is just as delicious though.
</p>

<p>
    How did it work out?  Not too bad.  She opens for the spoon and even managed
    to swallow some of it.  I think most of it came back up later, but it's a
    work in progress.
