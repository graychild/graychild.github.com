    Summer seemed to develop a little slower these last few months.  We hadn't
    noticed any of the explosive changes.  She must have been back building
    though, because she's tearing through accomplishments now.  In the last two
    days we've seen Summer:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Roll in all four directions (both ways from front or back)</li>
    <li>Turn the talking all the way up to "Mamamama" and "Dadadada"</li>
    <li>Sit for extended periods and in her high chair</li>
    <li>Hold her own bottle</li>
    <li>Start raising up on her knees in preparation for crawling</li>
</ul>

<p>
    She's becoming quite the handful, but we're loving every minute of it.
