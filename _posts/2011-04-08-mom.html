    "Dada" is suppose to be easier than "Mama," and both of those easier than
    "Mom" or "Dad."  Of course, we're now use to Summer preferring to take the
    hard way first.

    Summer has babbled "Dada" and "Mama" for a while, sometimes with extra
    syllables.  However, we haven't really noticed her addressing us directly
    with these terms.

    Starting on Mommy's birthday though, she seems to have upgraded to "Mom" and
    we've even seen her try to use it to get Mommy's attention a couple of
    times.  It doesn't seem flawless yet, as we've also seen her referring to
    her stuffed bunny as "Mom."  Still, it was a pretty nice birthday present.
