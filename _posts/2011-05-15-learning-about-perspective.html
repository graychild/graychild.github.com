    Summer has this fun new game where she tosses a little ball all over our
    house and crawls after it.  When she grabs it, she just tosses it again and
    continues crawling.

    This is a brain bender Summer ran into recently while playing her game.  You
    can almost see her trying to think through this challenge in the pictures.
