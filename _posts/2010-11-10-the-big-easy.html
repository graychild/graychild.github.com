    What did Summer do on her first trip out of Oklahoma?  She played while we
    drove her around, hung out with Grandma in hotels, shopped the Riverwalk and
    The French Quarter, met 800 geeks, charmed Dad's heroes and friends, got
    Mom, Dad, Grandma, and 11 friends thrown out of a bar, and gave Dad enough
    great slide photos to get him rated top speaker at the biggest Ruby
    conference ever held in the states.  You know, typical baby stuff.
