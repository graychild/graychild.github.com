    We read a book that mentions how children learn one thing and then all but
    drop it to move on to the next thing.  It's one thing to read that though
    and another to see it in action.  I think that's one of my favorite parts of
    watching Summer grow up.

    Early on, she worked on making sounds.  At some point though, she really cut
    back on that to focus on fine motor control of her hands and feet.  I didn't
    realize how much she had dropped the speech thing until it showed back up in
    full force sometime last week.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, it was short lived.  Speech is once again on the back burner
    this week as Summer works hard on rolling.  She can get about three quarters
    of the way over now and she started with the much harder back to front roll.

    The whole process is just like a machine at work.  She picks a new topic,
    works on it like crazy, and moves on once she's satisfied.  It's such an
    awesome thing to be able to watch.
