    More than once I've heard my Dad say, "I bought you expensive toys and you
    played with sticks and rocks."  Well, it may be a father-daughter thing,
    because Summer sure got a kick out of bouncing all over this cardboard box
    while the contractor installed the new sink that came out of it.
