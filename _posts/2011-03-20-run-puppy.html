    These images aren't of the best quality, but we had to act fast to catch
    this sneak attack on film.  For being as old as she is and not handling
    change well, Gypsy is surprisingly tolerant of her new fan.  Summer
    <b>loves</b> that dog.  Gypsy mainly just tries to pretend the baby doesn't
    exit… or throw things at her… or chase her.
