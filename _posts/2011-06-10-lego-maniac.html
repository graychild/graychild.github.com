    The box said 18 months and up but Summer couldn't wait that long to play
    with her Duplo bricks.  Or maybe Mommy couldn't wait.  The jury is still out on that one.  In 
    any case, Summer loves her Lego blocks, especially when she can rescue her Lego people
    from buildings and moving Lego cars.
