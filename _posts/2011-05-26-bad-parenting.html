    Yesterday, an adult at the party we attended reached down with the intention
    of wiping what he assumed was chocolate off of our daughter's nose.  We
    corrected, "No, it's not chocolate.  It's bad parenting."
</p>

<p>
    Summer picked up this scab when she Harry Houdini'd her way out of the car
    seat straps, the narrow space between the rear facing enclosure and the
    bench it sits on, and right on off the bench itself.  Her nose broke her
    fall nicely.

    More parenting triumphs:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Dad once caught Summer's outstretched fingers directly under a rear tire
        of his wheelchair and rolled right on over them.
    </li>
    <li>
        When Summer was just a baby, we clocked her head on the metal bracket of
        Daddy's headrest plenty good enough for her to see stars.
    </li>
    <li>
        Our favorite:  while we are gabbing with Summer's pediatrician, she
        casually falls over on the exam table, ramming her head into the wall.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Summer probably worries about our qualifications as parents and rightly so.
