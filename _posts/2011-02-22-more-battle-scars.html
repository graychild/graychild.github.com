    Another doctor's visit earned Summer some more shots.  This is probably the
    hardest set so far as they made her a bit fussy and sleepy for a day or so.
    The good news is that she now gets six months off before she needs another
    round.

    Her growth pattern is pretty much holding.  Her weight has come up a little
    into the 25%-50% range she was right on the edge of last time.  She's now 15
    lbs. 10 ozs.  Height has done the same, pushing her into the 90%-95% range
    at 27 1/2 inches.  There was a nine month old in the doctor's lobby that
    looked almost identical in height to Summer.  She will tower over us some
    day!
