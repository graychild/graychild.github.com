    We had our our family Christmas in the afternoon, after we drove back from
    Duncan.  It was a smaller attendance event and Summer fell asleep before we
    could finish opening gifts, but I think we all had a good time.

    Summer made a great haul including some age appropriate stuffed animals,
    not-at-all age appropriate Legos, and a ton of board books.  Grandpa also
    made a set of all-purpose shelves for Summer, designed by her mom.  I'm sure
    you'll see those pop-up in future photos.  Finally, Grandma Hall sent a doll
    crib from her childhood holding a doll from Aunt Nicole's childhood.

    While Summer's still too young to understand this holiday, her parents are 
    grateful to all who made it so wonderful for her!
