    Summer often presses her arms straight back when lying on the floor.  It
    seems she's worried that gravity could fail at any moment, forcing her to
    fly up to the ceiling.  I try to tell her that gravity has a pretty darn
    good success rate at this point, but she doesn't seem comforted.
