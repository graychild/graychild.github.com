    You would think that naming our unborn child would be easy considering we picked 
    them out years before we were even seriously considering the idea of talking 
    about having a kid.  As it turns out, the boys name was the only one that was easy.
    Chance David Gray was chosen years ago and has never changed. 
    
    The girl, however, was a real challenge. We both love the name Mercedes, including 
    the nicknames Mercy and Sadie.  Unfortunately, we disagreed on whether two middle names 
    was acceptable.  I wanted to give her Ann Leslie after my mom and me.  But James was
    adamantly against the idea, dropping Ann out because Leslie is a six or seven generation
    old name for my family.  But I do not like the way Mercedes Leslie sounds. So back to the name
    drawing board we went.  Some of the contenders were Jade, Willow, Storm, and Amber, among others.  
    But after nearly a month of debate, the clear winner was Summer Leslie Gray.
