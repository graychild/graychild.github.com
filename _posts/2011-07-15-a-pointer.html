    Summer has taken to pointing at the things she wants.  This is a nice
    addition to her communication repertoire, since we have to guess a lot less.
    It can be comical though when we take her to a Mexican restaurant and she
    keeps pointing at the pi&ntilde;atas hanging from the ceiling.
