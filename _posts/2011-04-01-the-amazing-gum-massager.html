    You've seen this toy in pictures before, but I thought I would draw
    attention its importance.  If you pile 45 toys on top of this thing and take
    Summer to the pile, it will take her all of 2.13 seconds to locate her gum
    massager.  She will bridge her body over huge gaps to reach it.  This is
    officially Summer's favorite toy.  It's no contest.  She loves the thing.

    Could it be the two top front teeth she cut this week driving the interest
    in the gum massager?
