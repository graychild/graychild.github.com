    This is Summer's pointer.  She aims it at anything she desires.  That's a
    lot.  For example, Summer might spend most of the meal at a Mexican
    restuarant pointing at the pi√±atas hanging from the ceiling.  She would like
    to have those.

    I just wanted you to officially meet the pointer, as you are quite likely to
    be seeing a lot more of it.
