    We gave Summer her Valentine's Day present a day early, because it was
    Sunday when we finished assembling it and it wasn't like we could hide it
    under our bed.  Besides, she'll never know it was the wrong day.  Please
    eat this message after reading.

    Summer was in the Jumperoo less than 30 seconds before she figured out how
    to make it bounce.  She was ecstatic.  I don't think I've ever seen her go
    quite that crazy over something.  She literally jumped until she was so
    tired that she could no longer hold her head up.  It was pure joy for all of
    us.
