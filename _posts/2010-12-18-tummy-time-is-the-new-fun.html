    When Summer was having her development evaluation, they asked if she liked 
    being on her tummy.  Dana and I both said an immediate, "No."  So they put
    her on her tummy while we watched and she made a liar out of both of us.
    She loved it.  Since that day, Tummy Time is suddenly cool.
