    The ultrasound most people call the 'Big Ultrasound' is where you find out the sex.  Naturally, we
    skipped that part.  Here's what we did see, though:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>fluid in bladder meant kidneys were working</li>
    <li>heartbeat was strong at 168 beats per minute</li>
    <li>taking practice breaths</li>
    <li>swallowing</li>
    <li>hiccups</li>
    <li>fluid at top of spine means low chance of neural tube defects</li>
    <li>hands playing with feet</li>
    <li>neck skin good, means low chance of Down's Syndrome</li>
    <li>lenses of eyes</li>
    <li>weighs about 9oz. - 63 percentile</li>
</ul>
