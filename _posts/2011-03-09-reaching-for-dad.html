    Summer's wiggles, rolls and partial rolls, and caterpillar crawling are
    giving her a minor bit of mobility.  The really cool part is that she often
    uses that motion to reach Dad, who seems to be on the popularity rise.  She
    grabs his fingers through the crib or his feet from the floor.
