    I played with Summer for quite a while tonight while Dana finished packing
    for our big trip tomorrow.  In watching her, I became more and more
    suspicious of something I was seeing:  Summer seems to be left handed.
</p>

<p>
    First, Summer now seems to be able to put her hand in her mouth whenever she
    chooses.  But it's always the same hand.  It's the left.
</p>

    Another thing I noticed when watching my daughter is that she's getting
    quite good at grabbing furry animals.  She can eventually get her hand onto
    it and then the hair gives her something to get a hold of.  She pulls them
    around for a while and eventually drops them.  Then, 50% of the time, she
    can start trying to get it again.  Why only half the time?  It depends if
    it landed on her left side or not.
</p>

<p>
    That's right folks, I think she's a lefty.
