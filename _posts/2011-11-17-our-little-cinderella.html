    Summer observed the cleaning crew at one of Dad's conferences.  Since then,
    she is obsessively polishing every surface of our house.  At first, I was
    thrilled to have this new child in my home, but it's gotten serious enough
    that I'm considering turning myself in for a violation of the child labor
    laws.
