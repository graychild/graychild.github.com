    Summer got her one year checkup from the doctor.  She passed a vision check
    and the doctor thinks she's cutting her one year molars now.  We've started
    giving her cold teethers again and it seems to be helping.
</p>

<p>
    She's still pretty low in weight classifications at under the 25 percentile.
    However, that reading may have been affected a bit by her recent bout with
    the childhood illness Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease.  She didn't eat for
    almost week while battling that, though she's feeling much better now.
</p>

<p>
    Height has also tapered off some to the 75 percentile.  It's still a bit
    early to tell, but they estimate she would be about 5'6" as an adult, if she
    holds to this current growth rate.
</p>

<p>
    All in all, it's a clean bill of health.  Hooray!
