    Kaylee and Summer have been working on their relationship lately.  Summer ran across this cat toy and discovered it was lightweight and fun to flip around.
    As the little feather moved seemingly on it's own accord, Kaylee became intrigued and then obsessed with the feather.  It didn't take Summer long to put two and two together and now enjoys playing with Kaylee anytime she sits on the floor.
