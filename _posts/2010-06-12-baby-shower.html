    Marsha and Layce threw me the best shower.  The cake was fantastic, the food was good and everyone
    seemed to have a really nice time.  I can't begin to say how thankful I am for all the lovely gifts.
    There is little in the world more valuable and cherished than the love and support of family and friends.
