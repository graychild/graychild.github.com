    You're never too young for the holidays!  We dressed up our little Pea in a
    Pod for her first Halloween and took her to the key stops:  neighbors and
    grandparents.
</p>

<p>
    The upsides?  The costume fit, though it was a near thing due to those long
    legs.  Summer also enjoyed mimicking Mimi sticking her tongue out.
</p>

<p>
    The downside?  Mommy got to eat all the candy!
