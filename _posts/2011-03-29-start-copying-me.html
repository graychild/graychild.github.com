    Baby's are always described as being such great mimics.  To be honest
    though, it hasn't been Summer's thing.  Until now.

    Just recently, say in the last week or so, Summer has started copying us.

    She seems to like copying head movements.  She copied me shaking my head
    until I was close to puking.  Even more adorably, she mimicked Mommy tilting
    her head sideways and almost upside down.  It's too cute.

    She also now clicks at the doggy as we do.  Sadly, the dog doesn't fall for
    it.

<p>
    Now she's almost as weird as us!
