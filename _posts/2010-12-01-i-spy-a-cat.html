    This was the week where Summer really seemed to take notice of the cat and
    dog.  She's seen them around before, of course, but she now actively tracks
    them when they come into sight.  This led to a hilarious episode where
    Summer's little head couldn't turn fast enough to keep up with Gypsy running
    around the living room.  The pets earn some smiles now as well.
