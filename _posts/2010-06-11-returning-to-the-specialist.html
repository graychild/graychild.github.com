    I did not have placenta previa but when they diagnosed me with gestational 
    diabetes, it was back to the specialist.  This time they wanted to monitor 
    the size of the baby and make sure it wasn't getting too big.  The bigger 
    the baby, the more likely I would have to have a C-Section.  In June it weighed
    3lbs, 9oz and had a belly that was ranging in the 80th percentile. By July, it 
    was 5lbs, 9oz and the belly was up in the 90's.  We thought for sure we were 
    going to have to do a C-Section.  Luckily, I was doing such a good job of 
    controlling my sugars that when we saw them again in August, it weighed 7lbs, 
    5oz and the belly had dropped to 78%! That meant a go for launch.
