    Summer looked me right in the eye this morning and very clearly stated that
    she wanted milk, with her hand.
</p>

<p>
    As always, Dana knew Summer could do this before I did.  She had seen her do
    it the night before.
</p>

<p>
    We weren't super sure though because some books we read told us not to
    expect to see signs before about seven months.  Of course, those same books
    recommend you start signing to your baby at about five or six months and we
    started very early.  Also, Summer chose to start with a very easy sign.  You
    just close your hand to signal "milk."
</p>

<p>
    No matter what the experts say, Dana and I are now in agreement.  Summer is
    signing milk.  It's obvious.  She made sure she had my attention this
    morning and then made a very deliberate sign.  You couldn't mistake it.  She
    was indeed hungry too, so she knew what it meant.  (We show her that sign
    just before giving her most bottles.)

    We're just thrilled.  She wants to talk to us!  We're listening, I mean
    watching, little girlâ€¦
