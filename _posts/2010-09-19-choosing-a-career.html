    Summer and I like to discuss super important topics as we spend time
    together in the mornings.  It's the time when we solve the big problems of
    the world.  Today's topic:  let's pick a job for Summer, a few years from
    now of course.  Don't laugh.  This is serious business.  You have to have
    time to think these decisions through.
</p>

<p>
    The choices:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>Ninja</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Come on who doesn't want to be a ninja?  Summer is uniquely qualified
        for this position, handing out the karate chops as frequently as any
        action figure.  Believe me, I took several whacks during this
        conversation alone.

    <dt><strong>Sound Effects Expert</strong></dt>

        Summer already has quite a suite of noises she can make without even
        resorting to using tools.  For example, she has a near flawless
        <a href="http://www.davidlouisedelman.com/wp-content/uploads/luke-skywalker-on-tonton.jpg">ton-ton</a> sound.
        Remember those guys?  If we allow her the use of toys, her PlayPlace
        puts out some bird sounds with or without musical accompaniment.  She's
        got the bases covered.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Pet Whisperer</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Anybody who can win over both of our geriatric and stubborn pets in
        about a month is a natural.  Summer actually threw up on the cat the
        other day and he didn't even leave the rocking chair!  In comparison, I
        can't get him to take food he loves from me.

    <dt><strong>Summer Glau Replacement in a Firefly Remake</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Dana told me once that she thought I chose Summer's name because I like
        the actress <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;biw=1058&amp;bih=764&amp;q=Summer+Glau&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=">Summer Glau</a>.
        I didn't.  It's just my favorite season.  However, I do enjoy watching
        Summer Glau because her face is so expressive and, as luck would have
        it, Summer Gray may have an even more expressive face.  So she may just
        be the perfect girl to revive the perfect show.

    As you can see, these are all amazing choices.  Summer's future looks very
    bright.
