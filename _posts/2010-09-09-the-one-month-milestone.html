    We assured the camera man that we have the calmest baby in the world.  I'm
    sure he's heard that line too many times.  Just as he expected, Summer 
    threw us a curve ball and became fussy as soon as we arrived.  I think they
    can smell a camera studio.  Luckily, we still got some great shots.
