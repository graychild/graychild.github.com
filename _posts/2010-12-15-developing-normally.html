    I think Summer's beginning to see a pattern:  go see the doctor every couple
    of months and get stabbed again.  Ouch!  She sure takes it well though.
    Total crying time after the shots this month:  maybe 60 seconds.
</p>

    As for the growth numbers, it's more of the same.  Still slim at 13 lbs. 2
    ozs. (25%) and getting taller at 25 1/2 ins (90%).  She's already
    getting close to outgrowing a car seat!
</p>

    In other news, Summer has now been evaluated developmentally twice this
    month.  The verdict:  developing normally and even ahead in some areas.
    She's going to be a handful.  That's always good to hear from the
    professionals.

    Finally, I just wanted to share with everyone something the doctor said
    today, "She has beautiful gray eyes."  She's my new hero.  (She also said
    Summer's around the age when the eyes choose their final color, so they may
    stay gray for good.)
