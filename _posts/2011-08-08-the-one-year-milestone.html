    We weren't too sure she was going to make it unscathed, when she came down
    with a nasty case of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease right before the big
    birthday.  But her fever broken a few days before and she was mostly back to
    normal for the magic day.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, we did have to move the party so she didn't make her friends
    sick.  Dad needs to run down to Austin for some business this week, so the
    actual celebration will have to be this weekend.  But it will be worth the
    wait!
</p>

<p>
    Summer's parents simply cannot believe how much she has grown and changed in
    so short a time.  What was one year seems to have passed all too quickly.
    However, we have loved every moment so far and we look forward to all those
    moments yet to come.
</p>

<p>
    Happy birthday, "Little Boo."  We adore you!
