    Summer had the first problem it was clear we would need some professional
    medical assistance to solve this week.  It was nothing too scary, but we 
    did fret over explaining it to the doctor.  We could just imaging how that
    would goâ€¦
</p>

<p>
    "Our daughter needs your help."
</p>

<p>
    "How do you know there's something wrong with her?"
</p>

<p>
    "We've had a few little clues, but the biggest was her crying fit last
    night."
</p>

<p>
    The dreaded question:  "How long did that last?"
</p>

<p>
    Our lame but totally truthful answer:  "About seven minutes."
</p>

<p>
    "You're joking right?  Welcome to parenthood."
</p>

<p>
    "You don't understand.  Our daughter doesn't cry."
</p>

<p>
    In the end, our doctors scored big points.  She fixed Summer.  She did it
    over the phone, just by telling what to get from the store.  The real win
    though was when she didn't ask us how we knew she had a problem!
