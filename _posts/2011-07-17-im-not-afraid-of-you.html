    I didn't manage to catch this episode on film, but it's too funny not to
    share.
</p>

<p>
    Summer and Kaylee (our cat) both love to play in the cardboard tunnel Dana
    built.  Sometimes at the same time.
</p>

<p>
    Well, I guess Kaylee felt a little threatened or cornered by the baby inside
    the tunnel.  Mommy and I heard the hiss and then she bounded off.
</p>

<p>
    Summer thought about it for a second, then chased that cat all over our
    house mimicing Kaylee's hiss the whole time.  Mommy and I were laughing too
    hard to rescue the cat and Summer must have chased her for a good ten
    minutes.

<p>
    I guess we know who is queen of this castle now!
