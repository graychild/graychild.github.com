    In the beginning, there was the peanut.  The day before Christmas Eve we had a bit of a scare when there was 
    a lot of bleeding.  But Dr. Reshef eased my fears the next morning with the first ultrasound.  
    A week later we heard the heartbeat and one week after that Reshef released me to my normal OB, Dr. Levine.  
    At 9 weeks, our little life form looked like a gummy bear.
