    Summer turned up with her first real illness today.  It had to happen
    eventually and we are thrilled we made it this far.
</p>

<p>
    She just had a runny nose this morning and we tried to wait it out.  She got
    a bit worse that evening though, so we took her to the doctor the next 
    morning.

<p>
    The doctors checked for the nasty stuff, but it was all negative.  They said
    it's probably just a cold and we would need to wait it out.  Luckily, she
    was already a little better by this time.

<p>
    Sadly, it didn't end there.  Dad was ill by Sunday and Mom showed signs on
    Monday.  We are toughing it out, but we're still getting use to this new
    aspect of parenting.

<p>
    We forgive you for making us sick, Sweetheart.
