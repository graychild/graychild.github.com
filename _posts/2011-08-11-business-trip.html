    Dad decided it was time to ease back into doing his work conferences.  That
    meant a road trip for all of Gray Productions Software Inc.:  employees and
    mascot baby.  The baby took the trip pretty well considering it was a day of
    driving, a long day conferencing with over 260 programmers, and another day
    of driving.
