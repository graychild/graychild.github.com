    I read in a book somewhere (yes, I even research being a mom) that kids like to put toys in a box and take toys out.  So I put the theory to the test and placed many of her favorite toys in this box.  Turns out the book was partly right.  Removing toys from the box is great fun.  Putting them back, not so much.
