    As Summer comes to the end of her fourth month, it is simply amazing to think back over all the things she has learned and experienced.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Experienced not one but three separate and distinct Christmases.</li>
        <li>Learned how to grab her feet.  Now she has a toy no matter where she goes.</li>
        <li>Learned how to successfully pass objects from one hand to another.</li>
        <li>Started combining multiple vowel sounds together to form words like aah-ooh and eeh-oow.</li>
        <li>Started making hard consonant sounds, although she has not yet combined them with vowels.</li>
        <li>Started eating solid food.</li>
        <li>Started demanding help to pull herself into a sitting position.</li>
        <li>Successfully rolled from her back to her tummy, independent of any help from anyone.</li>
    </ul>
    
    I can't think of the last time I learned that many new things in one month!  No wonder her nap times have increased.  I'd be exhausted too!
