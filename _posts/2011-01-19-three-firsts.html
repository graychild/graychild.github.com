    It was a big day for all of us, with three firsts for Summer.
</p>

<p>
    The first was the hardest as she had to say goodbye to a family member.
    Storm was put to sleep today after a brief battle with ugly health problems.
    Though they didn't know each other long, they were already working on their
    friendship.  Summer had pulled his hair and thrown up on him.  You might be
    surprised by how well this picky cat tolerated such things, at least from
    her.  Mom and Dad were even more sad, since they had been with Storm since
    they got married.  We miss you Stormy!
</p>

<p>
    The second first was starting vegetables.  Summer was ready.  We chose green
    beans to start with and she ate them like a pro.  She made several faces
    that looked like they tasted weird, but kept right on eating.
</p>

<p>
    The final first was when we found Summer's newly cut tooth tonight.  She
    won't cooperate for a picture yet, but, trust us, it's there.
