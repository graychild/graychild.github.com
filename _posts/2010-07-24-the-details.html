    It's the details that really make a nursery.  Dana's mother contributed the
    hat we hung on this cat, unifying our cowboy and cat themes.  I picked up
    some Toy Story Duplo sets for cowboys kid style and Dana handmade the
    perfect dust ruffle.  Finally, who doesn't need mad scientist ABC blocks?
