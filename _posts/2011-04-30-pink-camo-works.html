    As a skeptical dad, I questioned the value of pink camouflage.  I even asked
    on Twitter, "What you are suppose to hide in?"  Some responses were:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A giant vat of cotton candy</li>
    <li>Life size dollhouses</li>
    <li>A gaggle of tween girls</li>
    <li>Or <a href="http://www.miamism.com/wp-content/uploads/m/blogs/miamism/architecture/pinkhouse3.JPG">Miami</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    But the joke is on all of us.  As you can clearly see, it actually works!
