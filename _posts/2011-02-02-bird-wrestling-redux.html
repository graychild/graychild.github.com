    The bird war goes on!  Neither side is a clear winner, from what I can see.

    On a related note, Grandma seems to have the magic touch for picking stuffed
    animals that Summer loves to play with.  Summer has about five animals that
    are clearly favorites.  I bought one of those, but the other four, including
    this wacky green bird, came from Grandma.  Thanks Grandma!
